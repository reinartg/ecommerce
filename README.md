## REASON FOR MAKING THIS PROTOTYPE E-COMMERCE PRODUCT DETAILS PAGE
I received this task from a previous colleague of mine. He gave me a a wireframe over a product details page, normally seen on e-commerce sites, for small screens (mobile devices) and desktop screens including comments for some of the elements on the page. I decided to bring this to life in order to showcase my design and developer skills within developing web applications.


## ASSIGNMENT
- We need an interactive prototype for a product page, header and footer. We think you are the right person to do it for us.
- We do not have a graphical manual but I have attached our logotype and we use the colors A00D5B, F0DB44, ED2B91, 0FA7BA and 1591A0.
- When it comes to typography, we do use a lot of sans serif but you are free to use what you want to.
- The wireframe we got from your colleague looks good when it comes to layout, but if you want to change something change it... We would love to know the reason why.
- The design should be basic but distinct.
- We want the site to be responsive, work well with search engines and use a microformat for the product.  
- The product should be able to have three product images and, one is displayed big, by clicking on a thumbnail that image should be displayed big.
- The buy button should update total amount in the cart and the number of products in the cart.
- We intend to lift the CSS and HTML from the prototype to the real project so don't cut corners. Good element names in CSS/HTML and well written JS etc.
- There are comments in the wireframe for most elements.
